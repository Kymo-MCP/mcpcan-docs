# Become a Contributor

It's amazing that you want to contribute to MCPCAN! We've been looking forward to welcoming partners like you, especially excited to see your creativity and efforts~

Although we are a small team of less than five people, we have a big goal in mind — to create the most intuitive and easy-to-use MCP management platform. So every bit of help from the community is invaluable support to us.<br>
<br>Given our current team size, we need to advance the project rapidly and flexibly, but we also hope you can take fewer detours during the contribution process and have a smooth experience.<br><br>This contribution guide is prepared for you to help you quickly familiarize yourself with the codebase and our collaboration methods, so you can quickly get involved in the really interesting development work.
Like the MCPCAN project itself, this guide is continuously being iterated and improved. If you occasionally find discrepancies between it and the actual project, we appreciate your understanding, and we very much welcome your feedback to help us make it better.<br>
<br>Finally, please take a minute to read our [License](https://github.com/Kymo-MCP/mcpcan/blob/main/LICENSE), [Contributor Agreement](https://github.com/Kymo-MCP/mcpcan/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), and [Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Kymo-MCP/mcpcan/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)~ These are the foundation for us to maintain a good collaborative environment!


## Before You Start
We have solutions for both situations.<br>
1. [Check](https://github.com/Kymo-MCP/mcpcan/issues) existing issues<br>
2. [Create](https://github.com/Kymo-MCP/mcpcan/issues/new/choose) a new issue

### Feature Requests:
● If you want to select an existing issue, please leave a comment below it to express your intention.<br>
● If you want to submit a new feature request, please explain the goals of the proposed feature and provide as much detail as possible. We've provided you with preset request templates that you can fill in directly following the framework. We'll optimize feature requests based on priority. Below are the three templates we provide.<br>

Priority Assessment Criteria:
| Element Type | Priority |
|----------|----------|
| Features marked as high priority by team members | High Priority |
| Popular feature requests from our community feedback board | Medium Priority |
| Non-core features and minor improvements | Low Priority |
| Valuable but not immediate | Future Features |
<br>

### Anything Else (e.g., bug reports, performance optimization, spelling corrections):
● Start coding immediately<br>
<br>Priority Assessment Criteria:
| Issue Type | Priority |
|----------|----------|
| Core functionality bugs (cannot login, application cannot run, security vulnerabilities) | High Priority |
| Fix non-critical bugs, improve performance | Medium Priority |
| Minor fixes (spelling errors, UI confusion but functionality works) | Low Priority |
